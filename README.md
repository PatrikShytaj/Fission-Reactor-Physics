# Fission-Reactor-Physics
This repository contains Python code developed by me for the course Fission Reactor Physics, taught by Professor A. Cammi at Politecnico di Milano. The homeworks cover a broad range of topics, including: One-Group Diffusion Theory, Reactor Dynamics and Thermal Hydraulics &amp; Multigroup Diffusion Theory
