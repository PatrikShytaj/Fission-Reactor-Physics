# Fission-Reactor-Physics
This repository contains Python code developed by me for the course Fission Reactor Physics, taught by Professor A. Cammi at Politecnico di Milano. The homeworks cover a broad range of topics, including: One-Group Diffusion Theory, Reactor Dynamics and Thermal Hydraulics &amp; Multigroup Diffusion Theory

1. The first homework focuses on fundamental reactor physics calculations, including macroscopic cross sections, neutron energy distributions, fuel enrichment effects, and fission product buildup in thermal and fast reactor systems

2. The second homework applies one-group diffusion theory and numerical methods to determine criticality, neutron flux distributions, and optimal reactor geometries for various reactor configurations

3. The third homework involves a coupled neutronics–thermal-hydraulics stability analysis of an advanced or research reactor, including linear and nonlinear modeling and PI controller implementation

4. The fourth homework uses two-group diffusion theory to compute the critical width of a PWR-like slab reactor surrounded by an infinite water reflector
